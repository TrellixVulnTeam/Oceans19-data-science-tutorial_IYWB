# [Oceans'19](https://seattle19.oceansconference.org/program/tutorials-workshops-and-demonstrations/#1567091640951-f2487622-8baa), Data Science in Oceanography Tutorial

Seattle, Oct. 30th, 2019

This is a short crash course on the fundamentals of data science for oceanography research. We will go on a tour through concepts and tools established in the data science community which can facilitate discoveries from large and complex oceanographic data sets. Participants are expected to have basic knowledge of Python (equivalent to the Software Carpentry Lesson https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/ ). The main concepts are language independent but we will use Python tools to demonstrate them. We encourage participants who are experienced with other programming languages to review the Software Carpentry Lesson in advance. Also some familiarity with the bash shell may be helpful. We will use publicly available oceanographic datasets, we will share all the tutorial materials, and participants must bring their own laptop with Python installed.

#### Topics Covered:

Getting Started With Temporal And Spatial Oceanographic Data Sets

Wrangling Large Data From The Comfort of Your Laptop

From Data to Insights: Visualizations, Dimensionality Reduction, Prediction
